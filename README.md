### üéØ Project Overview
<p align="justify">
Accurate predicting the peak cooling demand is essential for designing energy-efficient air conditioning systems, especially in regions with extreme weather like Northern Nigeria. This project develops and provides Fourier series-based mathematical models that generate 24-hour profiles for:
</p>

- **Dry Bulb Temperature (Tdb)**
- **Relative Humidity (RH)**

<p align="justify">
The models are developed using 15 years of meterological data across 9 stations in Northern Nigeria (Yola, Bauchi, Maiduguri, Kaduna, Kano, Ilorin, Minna, Jos, and Sokoto) and can be used with two types of input:
</p>

- **Min/Max Inputs:** The minimum and maximum monthly average hourly values.
- **Raw Data Inputs:** Raw hourly data of a full month, from which the model computes the necessary averages.

### üî¨ Model Description
<p align="justify">
The prediction of hourly dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity distribution is based on a harmonic series (Fourier) analysis model used to approximate the diurnal variation.
The normalized hourly variation, $\Delta t$, is calculated as: </p>  

$$\Delta t(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{N} [a_n \sin(\frac{n\pi t}{12}) + b_n \cos(\frac{n\pi t}{12})]$$  


where $t$ is the hour of the day (1 to 24) and $N=12$ is the number of harmonics. The coefficients ($a_0, a_n, b_n$) are parameter-specific constants embedded in the MATLAB functions which are gotten using the equations stated in our paper.

The final predicted hourly value ($X_{hourly}$) is then scaled using the monthly minimum average ($X_{min}$) and the monthly average range ($\text{Range} = X_{max} - X_{min}$):

$$X_{hourly} = (\Delta t \cdot \text{Range}) + X_{min}$$
</p>

### üíª Usage Example
Below is a typical usage of the model functions:

```bash
clc; clear;

% EXAMPLE 1: Dry-bulb temperature prediction using Min/Max inputs
predicted_tdb_hourly_temp = min_max_model_Tdb(28.1900, 39.5700);
disp("Prediction for Tdb using Min/Max data:");
disp(predicted_tdb_hourly_temp);

% EXAMPLE 2: Dry-bulb temperature prediction using raw monthly data

pred_temp = raw_monthly_input_model_Tdb(data);
disp("Prediction for Tdb using raw monthly data:");
disp(pred_temp);

### üìä Model Validation
As detailed in the paper, the model was validated against existing models. Mean Absolute Percentage Error of below 0.02% was achieved when compared with Olorunmaiye's Model, and model showed strong correlation with low Mean Forecast Error when compared with Kohli and Zong models.
